I used Flexbox to structure and align elements properly, focusing on spacing, alignment, and aesthetics. 
The main challenge was ensuring even spacing and alignment within nested containers. 
I resolved this by adjusting justify-content, align-items, and flex properties. 
The assignment took about 2 to 3 hours, including debugging and refinements.
